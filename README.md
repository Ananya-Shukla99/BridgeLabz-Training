---

### 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Studied Procedural Programming and its limitations.
- Compared Procedural Programming with Object-Oriented Programming.
- Understood why OOP is preferred in modern software development.
- Learned core OOP concepts:
  - Class  
  - Object  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Abstraction  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  

- Implemented a sample program using procedural approach.
- Committed and pushed solutions to the repository.

### 📅 Day 2 – Constructors & Class Members  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

- Studied constructors and object initialization.
- Learned default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
