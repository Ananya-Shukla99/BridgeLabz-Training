## 📘 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming

---

### 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming  
(Date: 26-Dec-2025)

● Studied Procedural Programming and its limitations.  
● Compared Procedural Programming with Object-Oriented Programming.  
● Understood why OOP is preferred in modern software development.  

● Learned core OOP concepts:
  ● Class  
  ● Object  
  ● Encapsulation  
  ● Abstraction  
  ● Inheritance  
  ● Polymorphism  

● Implemented a sample program using a procedural approach.  
● Committed and pushed solutions to the repository.

### 📅 Day 3 – Static, Final & Inbuilt Keywords  
(Date: 28-Dec-2025)

● Studied the static keyword and its usage in Java.  
● Learned about static variables and static methods.  
● Understood the purpose of the final keyword.
